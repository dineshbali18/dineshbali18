👋 Hey, I’m Dinesh Bali
🔹 Full Stack Engineer | Scalable Backend Systems | Cloud-Native Developer
🔹 MS in CS @ Northwest Missouri State University | Ex-Bobble AI | Ex-Cognizant
📍 Missouri, USA | Open to Full-Time Backend / Full Stack Roles (U.S. Based)

🚀 About Me
I'm a results-driven full stack engineer with 5+ years of experience building high-performance web and mobile platforms. I specialize in designing and deploying real-time, event-driven backend systems using Java, Golang, and Node.js — with robust infrastructure on AWS.

From building Kafka-based pipelines that scale to 20,000+ TPS, to optimizing MySQL and Redis for millisecond-latency queries — I architect solutions that are resilient under load and easy to maintain.

I’ve led engineering teams, shipped apps used by 30M+ users, and deployed ML models for intelligent automation — all with a strong focus on reliability, concurrency, and DevOps excellence.
